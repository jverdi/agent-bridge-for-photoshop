Agent Bridge for Photoshop helps you automate Photoshop from the command line or through a coding agent like Codex or Claude Code.

Instead of repeating manual edits in Photoshop, you can describe what you want, run clear commands, and get consistent outputs.

## The pieces at a glance

- `Agent Bridge` Photoshop panel: connects Photoshop to automation.
- Bridge daemon (`psagent bridge daemon`): local service that relays commands to the panel.
- `psagent` CLI: run commands directly yourself.
- Skill (`/skill.md`): gives coding agents clear instructions for using Agent Bridge for Photoshop safely.

## What you can do with it

- Apply repeatable layer and text changes across files.
- Build predictable creative workflows for exports and handoff.
- Let an agent orchestrate steps while Photoshop stays local on your machine.
